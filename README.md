New Repository
I add some more content.

I have checked out a project called 30-second-of-python-code. The pull requests about shorter or better code were accepted. Some pull request about typo are ignored. This is a big project that made me confusing a lot. Everything seems well organized but I can't tell, because I don't really understand the code. But things looks tidy.
